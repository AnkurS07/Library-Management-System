# Library Management System

## The Project
We are a team of six software developers developing and designing a website and an app for a community library. The software shall allow its users to browse through items and reserve them to collect them afterwards as well as book events. The users shall be able to create an account via app or website and access the features of the library. The librarian shall be able to create accounts for users and verify their addresses. A head-librarian shall have the additional accessibility to set opening hours of library and assign shifts or jobs to other librarians. The development of the software consists of gathering requirements, designing the software, implementation and validation of the system.
